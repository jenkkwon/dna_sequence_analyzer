# DNA Sequence Analyzer (C Project)

This is a basic C program to analyze a DNA sequence input by the user. It performs:
- Base counting (A, T, C, G)
- GC content calculation
- Sequence validation

## Example Run
```
Enter a DNA sequence (A, T, C, G only):
ATTCGGCA

Base Counts:
A: 2
T: 2
C: 2
G: 2
GC Content: 50.00%
```

## Skills Demonstrated
- String processing
- Function modularity
- Input validation
- Header/source separation

## Build & Run
```bash
